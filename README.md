# QLearningGridAI

Using Reinforcement Learning to teach an Agent to traverse a grid world!

<br>

## Description

This project creates a 5x5 grid environment for an `agent` to then explore and exploit. Changing the `grid-world`, `rewards` and number of `episodes` will yield different results. Feel free to play around!

Compile and run `main.cpp` to execute.
